# The "Pre-execution Launch Environment" script
Oh boy, yes, a script fully written in classic Batch! Probably the last Batch-related thing I'll ever want to create to this complexity.
The premise is simple... This does stuff before and after a program launches. Why would you want this? No reason really, this covers ULTRA RARE cases no-one will ever really find themselves in.
If you want more information about stuff, check the "docs" folder.
## Why?
Questioning my decision of creating this is not the wisest choice honestly. It exists now, and could've been written in something like Python instead. Oh well.
